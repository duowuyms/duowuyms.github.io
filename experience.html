                    video analytics with Imitation Learning, where the agent is trained with the expert demonstrations
                    instead of an explicit reward function. Based on motion vectors extracted from camera codecs, we derive motion features
                    maps to capture video dynamics for ILCAS. Besides, ILCAS incorporates a cross-camera collaboration
                    scheme to exploit the cameras correlations for more proper configuration selection.
                    Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of ILCAS over SOTA solutions with 2-20.9%
                    improvement of mean accuracy and 19.9-85.3% reduction of chunk upload lag.

            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Abstract:</b> Traffic Engineering (TE) enables management of traffic in a manner that
                    optimizes utilization of network resources in an efficient and balanced manner. However,
                    existing TE
                    solutions face issues relating to scalability and complexity. In recent years, Segment Routing
                    (SR)
                    has emerged as a promising source routing paradigm. As one of the most important applications of
                    SR,
                    Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE), which enables a <i>headend</i> to steer traffic
                    along
                    specific paths represented as ordered lists of instructions called <i>segment lists</i>, has the
                    capability to overcome the above challenges due to its flexibility and scalability. In this
                    paper,
                    we conduct a comprehensive survey on SR-TE. A thorough review of SR-TE architecture is provided
                    in
                    the first place, reviewing the core components and implementation of SR-TE such as SR Policy,
                    Flexible
                    Algorithm and SR-native algorithm. Strengths of SR-TE are also discussed, as well as its major
                    challenges. Next, we dwell on the recent SR-TE researches on routing optimization with various
                    intents, e.g., optimization on link utilization, throughput, QoE (Quality of Experience) and
                    energy
                    consumption. Afterwards, node management for SR-TE are investigated, including SR node
                    deployment
                    and candidate node selection. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges of current research
                    activities and propose several research directions worth of future exploration.
